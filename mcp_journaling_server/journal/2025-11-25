I went out my friends I made in Housr. Nishant, SK Sir and Simran.
I threw a pre-birthday celebration party at the piano man. It was an amazing experience. I am not sure but I felt the experience very unreal as if it's all dramatic or a dream sequence and it's not happening in real. I sometimes feel in certain situations very unreal. Even when I think about it - it feels distant. Though If I try to forget this fact then it was fun. the live music was good. Nishant was too obsessed with the singer girl. Simran my best buddy and SK Sir is our forever support. It was a fun eve.
