Hey its me rini .. Today was a normal day but I did work on coding a mcp server which is really fun. The idea is to use this mcp server to create journals everyday and then summarize it sometime in terms of stories or just gather the highlight of the day or just get all the happy moments. get indpiration. getting in touch with yourself more. I love the idea myself. Its something i can do everyday its fun its easy and replaying some memories back will always make it so much fun!
